# Getting Started

Follow these steps to scan your first prefab.

## 1. Open the Dashboard
Go to `Tools > Prefab Dependency Tracker > Open Main Window`.
You will see a split-view window:
- **Left Panel**: Your Project's Prefabs.
- **Right Panel**: Scan Results.

## 2. Select a Target
In the **Left Panel**, click on any prefab you want to investigate. 
- You can search for specific prefabs using the filter.
- Hold `Ctrl` (Windows) / `Cmd` (Mac) to select multiple prefabs.

## 3. Scan
Click the large green **SCAN** button.
The tool will process your request (this happens asynchronously so Unity won't freeze).

## 4. Analyze Results
The **Right Panel** will display the results:

| Result Type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Tree View** | Shows a hierarchy of where the prefab is used. |
| **✅ Checkmark** | The prefab is **Safe to Delete**. No dependencies found in the current scope. |

> **Pro Tip:** Double-click any result in the list to ping the object in the Hierarchy or Project view.
