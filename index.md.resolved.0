## Why do I need this?

In large Unity projects, prefabs become a tangled web of references. 
- **The Pain:** You want to delete a prefab, but you're terrified it might be used *somewhere* in a forgotten scene.
- **The Solution:** Prefab Dependency Tracker scans your entire project (or specific scopes) to tell you *exactly* where a prefab is used.

## Key Benefits

- **🛡️ Confidence**: Delete unused assets without breaking your game.
- **⚡ Performance**: Find heavy prefabs that are being pulled into scenes unexpectedly.
- **🔍 Deep Scanning**: Detects nested prefabs, script references, and direct scene usage.
- **🚀 Workflow**: Integrated directly into the Unity Editor with a sleek, dark-themed UI.
